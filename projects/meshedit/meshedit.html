<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
<p class = "medium">
Mesh Editor was an interesting dive into the world of 3D Graphics, and the underlying architecture that enables the geometric manipulations that power tools like Blender, and Maya.
This project delves into both rendering Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces through a liberal application of <b>de Casteljau's algorithm</b>
as well as manipulation of triangulated meshes, including edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh subdivision.

<p class = "medium">
In order to draw arbitrary splines, we leverage <b>de Casteljau’s algorithm</b>. In essence, the algorithm requires as inputs a series of control
points of the curve we wish to interpolate. We will also need to define <var>t</var>, a quantity between 0 and 1. We will call all of these initial control
points the 0th degree control points. Between each pair of adjacent control points, we draw a new intermediate control point at the location
defined as the linear interpolation of the leftmost point and the rightmost point with parameter <var>t</var>. We repeat this process for each dual pair of
adjacent 0th degree control points, to draw our 1st degree control points. Note that if we initially had <var>n</var> 0th degree control points, we will now
have <var>n - 1</var> first degree control points. We will apply this process on our first degree control points, deriving 2nd degree control points, and
similarly on second degree control points and 3rd degree control points etc. until we are left with a singular <var>(n - 1)</var> th degree control point.
This is one point on the Bezier curve defined by the 0th degree control points. Modulating <var>t</var> to infinitesimally small degrees allows us to project
the entire curve defined by our control points.
</p>
</div>

<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
The implementation was a direct map of the aforementioned algorithm. At each function invocation, the input vector represented our <var>ith</var>
degree control points. Between each adjacent pair in this vector, I simply linearly interpolated the points with curve parameter <var>t</var>,
pushing these new points to a collection vector, and returning the collection vector at the end, which represented the <var>(i + 1)</var>
degree control points.

The extension from rendering Bezier curves to rendering Bezier surfaces is actually more straightforward than I expected.
We can leverage separable 1-dimensional de Casteljau’s algorithm to interpolate point <var>(u, v)</var> on our Bezier patch.
If we have <var>m</var> rows of original control points, each with <var>n</var> control points (<var>m</var> x <var>n</var>) control points
total, we treat each row of <var>n</var> control points as the initial control points to a Bezier curve, and thus we can use de
Casteljau’s algorithm to evaluate a point on each of the <var>m</var> curves, given linear interpolation parameter <var>u</var>
(as a direct mirror to task 1). This will leave us with a set of <var>m</var> points, which we can again treat as the original control points
of a Bezier curve, allowing us to again utilize de Casteljau’s algorithm to interpolate a point on this curve given linear interpolation
parameter <var>v</var>. Thus we are left with a single point on our Bezier patch, which was evaluated at <var>(u, v)</var>.
</p>
</div>


<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
Much like in task 1, the substance of the problem centers around evaluating de Casteljau’s algorithm. In part 1, we wrote a function
(<code>evaluateStep</code>) that took as input a vector of control points and a linear interpolation parameter, and returned a vector of
control points that corresponded to the subsequent stage of de Casteljau’s algorithm. For this part, we first write a function that
will <code>evaluateStep</code> on a vector with argument <var>u</var>, and <code>evaluateStep</code> on the return to <code>evaluateStep</code>
perpetually, until we interpolate our singular point on the Bezier curve; we can call this function <code>evaluate1D</code>. Thus, appealing
to our algorithm described above, we need only call <code>evaluate1D</code> with parameter <var>u</var> on all of our rows of control points,
each stored as a vector in the Bezier patch, pushing the resulting interpolated points into another vector, on which we will again call
<code>evaluate1D</code> with parameter <var>v</var> to interpolate the actual point on our Bezier patch.

<h3 align="left">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
Thankfully, the half-edge mesh makes computing area-weighted vertex normals quite elegant. The following pseudocode gives the outline: <br>
</p>
</div>

<div align = "left">
<code>
Initialize a tracker for total area (TA), and total vector sum (TVS)<br>
For each vertex:
<ol>
<li>Query the initial half-edge rooted at this vertex (h = v->halfedge()). </li>
<li>Retrieve h’s face, and query the face’s normal vector (face_norm = h->face()->norm()). </li>
<li>Compute the area of the face.</li>
<li>Add area to TA</li>
<li>Add area * face_norm to TVS</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-5 for all adjacent faces to the given vertex</li></ol></code>
</div>

<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
To find all adjacent faces of a vertex given our initial vertex <code>v</code> and halfedge <code>h</code>, we can get the half-edge of
the next face by finding <nobr><code>h->twin()->next()</code></nobr>, and from here we can query the for loop again. We repeat for each face until we
loop back to <code>h</code>.

To implement edge flips, I followed the guidelines specified by this helpful <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf" target = "_blank">link</a>
from the folks at CMU. The essence of this guide is as follows. First we save a pointer (in the form of an Iterator) for each of the half edges,
vertices, edges, and faces from our starter mesh. Next, since edge flips do not utilize new elements, we can simply assign our elements such that
our central edge flips the vertices from which it is rooted, and thus all corresponding vertices, edges, faces, and halfedge pointers are updated
as a result. As per the guide, we element assign <b>every</b> half edge, vertex, edge, and face regardless of whether or not edge flipping alters its
starting state.

Concretely, the guide tells us to do the following. We’ll take a look at the picture on the left side, and attempt to take a freeze frame of the
state of the elements (edges, faces etc.). What this means is that we’ll generate variables for each of the mesh components to start. Next we’ll
check to see whether or not we ought to be generating new mesh components. It turns out for edge flips, the starter components are sufficient, so
we can just pass this step for now. Now we will modify the mesh by using the variables generated above and assigning their corresponding fields
based on the picture on the right side, the flipped edge side. Finally, if our mesh renovation deletes components, we’ll do that as the final step,
but again with edge flips we can just skip this step.

<h3 align="left">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

<div align = "justify">
<p class = "left">
As with task 4, the implementation of this part is quite straightforward, by following the earlier link. Simply begin by saving pointers for each
of the half edges, vertices, edges, and faces. This time we will need to create 1 vertex, 3 edges, 2 faces, and 6 half-edges. Then, using the
diagram I included above, I was able to sequentially assign all neighbors and attributes for every half edge, vertex, edge, and face to account
for the new central vertex, and the vertices that radiate out from it. It is important to note, the new vertex generated is positioned at the
midpoint of the edge it cuts.

components to start. Next we’ll check to see whether or not we ought to be generating new mesh components. For mesh splits, we will need to
generate 1 vertex, 3 edges, 2 faces, and 6 halfedges (in fact, my implementation creates 1 vertex, 4 edges, 4 faces, and 8 halfedges just because
the component mapping was slightly more intuitive for me that way). Now we will modify the mesh by using the variables generated above and
assigning their corresponding fields based on the picture on the right side, the split edge side (an example has been done in the diagram for
reference). Finally, for edge splits, we will not need to delete components, however in my implementation, we actually did delete one edge,
two half edges, and 2 faces (to account for the extra components created).

Loop subdivision allows for a lightweight yet efficacious mode of upsampling triangulated meshes. The first step is to calculate the new positions
for all of the vertices in our starter mesh (we’ll ignore boundary vertices at first, since this introduces a new layer of complexity). Thus,
iterating over all the vertices in our starter mesh, we employ the following scheme to redraw weights for existing vertices. First, add together
each of the positions of all neighbouring vertices of <var>v</var>. Then, set the <code>newPosition</code> field of <var>v</var> to be
<code>(1 - deg(v) * u) * v->position + deg(v) * sumNeighbourPositions)</code>, where if the degree of <var>v</var> is 3, <var>u</var> is (3/16),
and otherwise, <var>u</var> is (3/(deg(v) * 8)). While we’re iterating through all our initial vertices, we will set
their <code>isNew</code> tracker flags to be false (we’ll see why later).
</p>
</div>
<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
As we know, in loop subdivision, we will add a new vertex on every starter edge, and we will of course need to assign a position to these new
vertices as well, so we begin by iterating through all of the starter edges. For every edge, we can calculate the position of the new vertex
on that edge and summarily set the <code>newPosition</code> attribute of our edge to be (3/8)*(<var>A</var> + <var>B</var>) + (1/8)(<var>C</var> + <var>D</var>)
where <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, and  <var>D</var> are the positions of the vertices defined in the above diagram. Of course these
edges are all starter edges, so we will set their <code>isNew</code> tracker flags to be false as well. Simultaneously, we will create a
tracking array of <code>old_edges</code>, and push all edges we iterate over into this array.
</p>
</div>
<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
Now, with all the mise en place complete, we can begin the actual mesh modifications. We start by splitting all of the starter edges (in <code>old_edges</code>)
of the mesh (see now why we tracked all the old edges?). We can leverage our <code>splitEdge</code> function from task 5 to do this easily, however, we will
make a tiny alteration to this function; when an edge is split, we assign the new vertex’s <code>newPosition</code> field to be the <code>newPosition</code> field of the
split edge.
</p>
</div>
<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
The second to last step in loop subdivision is to flip every edge that links two starter vertices, so we can simply iterate through all our edges
and check, flipping edges with our <code>edgeFlip</code> function from task 4 as aforementioned.
</p>
</div>
<div align = "justify">
<p class = "medium">
Finally, all we need to do is push the updates to the vertex positions, so for all vertices, just set their <code>position</code> field to be
equal to their <code>newPosition</code> field!

Unfortunately, edges and corners don’t hold up well under loop subdivision. As we subdivide the mesh, if we observe the way the loop subdivision
scheme functions, essentially for positions of new vertices, we blend and smooth our mesh by taking an average position of neighboring vertices,
and reweight our starter vertices similarly. As a result, sharp mesh elements, like edges and corners are dulled with successive subdivisions
as they regress to the vertices neighboring them.

We can temper this effect a bit, by pre-splitting some edges, although this is far from the sharpness that would be acceptable for creasing.
Observe in the torus below, we pre-split some of the edges on one side of the donut. Later when we subdivide, the general edge and corner shape
is apparent, considerably more so than without preprocessing.

The issue that causes the weird asymmetry when subdividing the cube is actually an underlying artifact of the mesh’s triangulation. Notice that the
underlying geometry triangulation splits each face along only one diagonal? The effect of this is that when the triangles are subdivided, all new

The intuition becomes starkly apparent when we compare the subdivision right before the reweighting of our asymmetric triangulation
and our symmetric triangulation. New point positions will be calculated (and starter vertex positions will be reweighted) according to a linear
combination of neighbor vertex positions. Intuitively, if the triangulation of our mesh leaves vertices only in one orientation, linear
combinations of the vertices will necessarily mirror this orientation. Put another way, asymmetry in the initial triangulation will lead to
asymmetry in the first subdivision, which in turn leads to asymmetry in the second subdivision ad infinitum.

We can fix this issue by splitting every diagonal edge first, thereby imposing a symmetric distribution of vertices. Essentially now, since the
initial triangulation is symmetric, any additional vertices will be symmetrically added, and symmetrically reweighted as well.

<b><i>Boundaries:</i></b>

Boundaries are weird. Supposedly I should be able to iterate through all starter vertices, and if I find a boundary vertex, I need to reweight this
vertex such that it has position: (1/8) * A + (3/4) * B + (1/8) * C. Then for all boundary edges, I simply need to put a vertex such that it cuts
the original edge at the center. Did this work?

Kind of... we can see that this new scheme certainly doesn’t ignore boundary elements, but it looks a little odd. There seems to be noise in the
mesh. The fact that the subdivision occurs correctly however, the positions of new boundary triangles are just a little off leads me to believe
that I am misinterpreting some part. I think I may be misunderstanding the weighting system, but of the numerous articles I consulted to figure
this part out, they all point to this same weighting scheme. On the bright side, at least it doesn’t crash upsampling the Beetle car.

This is an interesting alternate subdivision mode. The basis for this mode of upsampling is as follows: first, we will precalculate (as in loop
subdivision) the <code>newPosition</code> parameter of all the starter vertices. Iterating through the vertices, triadic subdivision tells us that
the weight of old vertices should be equal to <code>(1 - alpha) * v->position + alpha * avgNeighbourPosition; alpha is equal to (4 - 2 * cos(2pi / deg(v)) / 9)</code>.
Having done this, the next step is to place a new vertex at the centroid of each face of the starter mesh. All that’s left to do is to add new
edges connecting the centroids to the vertices of the triangles in which they are rooted, and reset halfedges, edges, vertices, and faces as in
tasks 4 and 5. Finally, for all the vertices for which we previously computed a <code>newPosition</code> field, we push the <code>newPosition</code>
to the <code>position</code> field and we’re done!
