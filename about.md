<p >Hi! My name is Gregory. I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and I'm now working as a software engineer at Walt Disney Animation Studios. I made this website as a collection of interesting projects I wanted to share and to hopefully provide a unified public representation of who I am. I love computer graphics, especially its application to entertainment like animated movies or graphics for video games. I've always considered computer graphics to be the pinnacle, where artistic creativity and technological ingenuity have harmoniously collided. Outside of work, I really enjoy movies, both animated and not, really well written speeches (ask me to recite Anton Ego's final monologue from Ratatouille), video games, cooking, looking at really ~aesthetic~ PC builds, and drinking really cold, crisp water. Please feel free to look around! I hope you find something that piques your interest.</p>
